# Express.js Learning Project

This project serves as a practice and learning tool for **Express.js**, a minimalistic framework for Node.js. The goal of this project is to help developers (especially beginners) learn key concepts such as routing, middleware, error handling, and application structure in Express.js.

## Project Overview

This project implements a basic Express.js server that handles requests, responses, routing, and custom middleware. The application includes features like:
- Basic Routing
- Core Concepts of different Middlewares
- Error handling and logging
- Environment-based configuration

You will learn how to structure a clean and maintainable Express application and set up a development environment with tools like Nodemon for auto-restart.

## Features

- **Routing**: Organized and modular routing for handling HTTP requests, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for tasks such as logging, authentication, and validation.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error-handling mechanism to capture and manage application errors effectively.
- **Static File Serving**: Ability to serve static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports environment-based settings for development, testing, and production environments using environment variables.
- **Database Integration**: Preconfigured support for MongoDB, enabling the app to connect to a NoSQL database (optional).
- **Scalable Structure**: Follows a scalable folder structure that separates concerns, improving maintainability.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later): You can download the latest version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager): Bundled with Node.js.
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository.
- **MongoDB** (optional): If you are planning to integrate the project with a MongoDB database. Download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

To verify the installation of Node.js and npm, you can run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
