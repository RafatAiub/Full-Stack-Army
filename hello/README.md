## Project Overview

This project implements a basic Express.js server that handles requests, responses, routing, and custom middleware. The application includes features like:
- RESTful APIs
- CRUD operations
- Error handling and logging
- Static file serving (CSS, images, etc.)
- Environment-based configuration

You will learn how to structure a clean and maintainable Express application and set up a development environment with tools like Nodemon for auto-restart.
